/*
Abstract Data Type
key value pairs- data types dont have to match
Optimised for retrieval (when you know the key)
Associative array is a type of hash table

To convert String keys to integers we use Object.hasCode() method - Hashing
Collision occurs when more than one value has the same hash value

Load factor- tells how much the table is full, can play role determining the time complexity for retrival
eg - 0.4 (table 40% full)
